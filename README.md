# MomoLib
A small C++ library for personal usage.

**This library is still in progress and there are probably a lot of bugs in the code, so use it on your risk. I will try to fix them as soon as possible.**

for now there is implementation of:
- matrices in C++: matrix.h
- easy get time and function test in C++: time.h
- splay tree in C++: splay_tree.h
- dynamic array in C++: marray.h
- complex numbers in C++: complex.h
- delegate in C++: delegate.h
- events in C++: event.h
- big integers in C++ : big_integer.h
- some helpful print and more: utils.h
